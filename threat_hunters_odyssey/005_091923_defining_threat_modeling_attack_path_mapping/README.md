# Episode 2 - Defining Threat Modeling and Attack Path Mapping

In this video blog, I am giving my understanding of September 19, 2023 of what "Threat Modeling" and "Attack Path Mapping" mean to me as a defender of a cloud native AWS environment.

Threat modeling is a structured and systematic approach used in cybersecurity to identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential security threats and vulnerabilities within a system, application, or network. It involves the following key steps:

1. **Asset Identification**: Identify and define the valuable assets or components within the system that need protection, such as data, software, hardware, and network resources.

2. **Threat Identification**: Enumerate and categorize potential threats and risks that could target the identified assets. Threats can include malicious actors, software vulnerabilities, hardware failures, and environmental hazards.

3. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Analyze the system's architecture, design, and implementation to identify vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by the identified threats. Vulnerabilities can be technical, procedural, or operational in nature.

4. **Attack Surface Assessment**: Determine the points of interaction or entry (attack surface) where threats can potentially exploit vulnerabilities. This includes considering entry points such as user interfaces, network interfaces, and APIs.

5. **Threat Scenarios**: Create specific threat scenarios or attack vectors that describe how threats could exploit vulnerabilities to compromise assets. These scenarios help in understanding the potential impact of an attack.

6. **Risk Assessment**: Assess the likelihood and potential impact of each threat scenario. This involves assigning a risk rating or score to each scenario based on factors like probability, severity, and potential consequences.

7. **Mitigation Strategies**: Develop and prioritize mitigation strategies and security controls to address the identified risks. These controls can include implementing access controls, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and other security measures.

8. **Documentation**: Document the entire threat modeling process, including the identified assets, threats, vulnerabilities, scenarios, risk assessments, and mitigation strategies. This documentation serves as a reference for ongoing security efforts.

9. **Validation and Iteration**: Validate the threat model through testing, analysis, and peer review to ensure its accuracy and completeness. Iterate on the model as necessary to incorporate new information or changes to the system.

The goal of threat modeling is to proactively identify and address security weaknesses, helping organizations make informed decisions about security measures and resource allocation. It enables them to prioritize their efforts and resources on the most critical security concerns and reduce the overall risk of security breaches and incidents.

## Definition of Attack Path Mapping (source ChatGPT 3.5)
Attack path mapping is a cybersecurity technique used to identify and visualize potential pathways that a cyber attacker could take to compromise a network or system. It is a crucial part of threat modeling and risk assessment in cybersecurity. The primary goal of attack path mapping is to understand how an attacker might move through a network or system to achieve their objectives, such as gaining unauthorized access, stealing sensitive data, or disrupting services.

Here are the key steps involved in attack path mapping:

1. **Asset Identification**: Identify all the assets within the network or system that need protection. This includes servers, workstations, databases, routers, and any other components that could be targeted by an attacker.

2. **Threat Identification**: Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Threats could include malware, unauthorized users, insider threats, and more. Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the system's security that could be exploited.

3. **Mapping Attack Paths**: Once assets and potential threats are identified, the next step is to map out the possible attack paths. This involves determining how an attacker could move from one asset to another by exploiting vulnerabilities and taking advantage of weaknesses in the security controls.

4. **Risk Assessment**: Assess the risks associated with each attack path. Determine the likelihood of each path being exploited and the potential impact if it were successful. This information helps prioritize which paths to address first.

5. **Countermeasures**: Develop and implement countermeasures to mitigate the risks associated with the identified attack paths. Countermeasures may include patches and updates, improved access controls, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and other security measures.

6. **Monitoring and Testing**: Continuously monitor the network or system for any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious activity. Regularly test the security controls to ensure they are effective in preventing or mitigating attacks.

7. **Documentation and Visualization**: Document the attack paths and their associated risks, countermeasures, and monitoring strategies. Visualization tools and techniques can be used to create visual representations of attack paths, making it easier for security teams to understand and communicate the potential threats.

Attack path mapping helps organizations proactively identify and address security weaknesses, making it an essential part of overall cybersecurity risk management. It allows security professionals to prioritize their efforts and resources on the most critical areas to protect against potential attacks.
